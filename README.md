The updated graphs now include the membrane potential changes over time and the rate of change of membrane potential (dV/dt) with the specified membrane capacitance (CmCm​):
Upper Graph (Membrane Potential Changes Over Time):
This graph, in blue, shows the changes in membrane potential (mV) over time (ms). It illustrates the dynamics of the membrane potential, including any action potentials.
Lower Graph (Rate of Change of Membrane Potential Over Time with CmCm​):
    The graph in orange represents the rate of change of membrane potential (dV/dt) over time, calculated using the specified membrane capacitance value (Cm=1×10−6Cm​=1×10−6 F).
    It shows how the membrane potential's rate of change varies over time, which is essential for understanding the electrophysiological behavior of the cell under study.
